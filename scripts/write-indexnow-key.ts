/**
 * Emit the IndexNow ownership file into dist/ during postbuild.
 *
 * INDEXNOW_KEY is intentionally a build-time variable: every fork/site gets
 * its own key without committing a generated <key>.txt file to the template.
 * When unset, the key file step is skipped (a committed public/<key>.txt still
 * works for submission).
 *
 * The deploy marker (.well-known/anvilwiki-deploy.txt) is INDEPENDENT of the
 * key: it records which Git commit this build produced, so the post-CI
 * IndexNow workflow can wait for the new deployment instead of racing it.
 * It is written whenever a commit SHA is available at build time.
